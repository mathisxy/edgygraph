    Create and execute a graph defined by a list of edges


    ## Generic Typing
    The graph supports different state management strategies through generic parameters:

    * **Simple Inheritance (Covariance):** Extend `State` and `Shared` classes. 
        Ideal for smaller projects with minimal boilerplate.
    * **Protocol-based (Duck Typing):** Implement `StateProtocol` and `SharedProtocol`. 
        Recommended for scalable projects where multiple state types are merged.
    * **Disabled Type Checking:** Use `typing.Any` to bypass strict typing.

    ---

    ## Branching & Edge Logic
    A graph consists of one or more **branches**. A branch is defined as a tuple: 
    `branch = (Source, Next_1, ..., Next_n, JoinParameter)`

    ### Edge Generation
    Edges are automatically generated between adjacent elements in the tuple, **excluding the final JoinParameter**:

    ```
    T = (E_0, …, E_{n−1})

    ∀ x ∈ {0, …, n−3}: # n−3 because the last element is the join element

        Edges = {(a, b) ∈ E_x × E_{x+1} | a is a Source ∧ b is a Next}

    where × denotes the Cartesian product.

    ```

    **Example:**
    `edges = [(START, node1, node2, node3)]`
    1. (START -> node1)
    2. (node1 -> node2)

    *Note: `node3` is the join point, not a target of `node2`.*

    ---

    ## Synchronization

    The graph manages state consistency on two levels:

    - **Internal (Step Sync)**
        Parallel executing nodes in branches are synchronized at each step.
        The state is merged after each step.

    - **External (Branch Sync)**
        Branches are synchronized at the `join` point.


    ### Spawning
    A branch is triggered **immediately before** its `Source` is executed in another branch.
    * `START`: Initial execution point.
    * `Node`: Spawns when a specific node is executed in another branch.
    * `List[Node]`: Spawns when any node in the list is executed in another branch.


    ### Joining
    Joining synchronizes multiple branches before moving to the next step.
    * `None`: No synchronization and no merge of the state.
    * `END`: Joins all branches at the graph's conclusion to return the merged state.
    * `Node`: Other branches wait until all branches targeting this node have arrived and then merge the states before executing the node.

    ---

    ## Notation Reference

    ```
    Source: Node, START, Exception, (Exception, Node), List[Source]
    Next:   Node, None, List[Next], Callable[[State, Shared], Next]
    Join:   Node, END, None
    ```

    ### Error Handling
    The `Exception` source can be used to create fallback paths:
    * `Exception`: Catches any error in preceding nodes of the same branch.
    * `(Exception, [node1, node2])`: Specifically handles errors occurring in `node1` or `node2`.
