        Runs the node with the given state and shared state from the graph.

        Operations on the state are merged in the graphs state after the node has finished.
        Therefore, the state is not shared between nodes and operations are safe.

        Operations on the shared state are reflected in all parallel running nodes.
        Therefore, the shared state is shared between nodes and operations are not safe without using the Lock.
        The lock can be accessed via `shared.lock`.

            state: The state of the graph.

            None. The instance references of the arguments are used in the graph to enable variance.
